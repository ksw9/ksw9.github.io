Katharine is interested in how environmental changes--including climate change, habitat fragmentation, and mass incarceration--shape our pathogen exposures and determine who gets sick. She is committed to mentoring the next generation of scientists and public health advocates. 

Outside of work, she is often at the nearby trailhead.
