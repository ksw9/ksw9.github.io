I am an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, majoring in Systems Engineering with a thematic minor in biomedical engineering. My career goal for the medical field is to become a physician to increase the representation of Indigenous people in medicine and advance access to health care in Indian countries. I am open to research, and learning more about what the health department has to offer, and in my free time, you can see me at the courts playing basketball or running.
