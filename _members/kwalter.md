Katharine is interested in how environmental change--including climate change, habitat transformation, and mass incarceration--shapes our pathogen exposures and determines who gets sick. She is committed to mentoring the next generation of scientists and public health advocates. She completed her PhD at Yale University in Maria Diuk-Wasser's Laboratory and her postdoctoral research at Stanford University in the Jason Andrews Laboratory.

Outside of work, she is often looking for her snowboots for a walk to the local bookshop.
