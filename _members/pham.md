Mui Pham completed her Ph.D. at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, where she developed mathematical models to study the transmission dynamics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units and SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals and secondary schools. Before joining the Evo-Epi Lab, she was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where her work focused on understanding the relationship between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in hospital-associated pathogens. Her research interests lie at the intersection of antimicrobial resistance, genomics, and mathematical modeling. Outside of work, she enjoys rock climbing, hiking, and Lindy Hop dancing.
