Pathogen evolution creates an extraordinary epidemiological record. We develop and apply evolutionary approaches to answer open questions about pathogen transmission & epidemiological dynamics with a current focus on *M. tuberculosis*. Our goal is to directly inform public health in low-income settings.

Our group is part of the [Division of Epidemiology](https://medicine.utah.edu/internal-medicine/epidemiology) at the University of Utah, nestled into the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains. We work across disciplines and have several research openings for students and fellows at the intersection of epidemiology and environmental change.
