# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Current Opportunties

We are committed to creating an inclusive, safe research community that, in particular, invites and supports students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. We are committed to anti-racist, anti-imperialist, abolitionist research praxis and group culture. We are highly collaborative and uninterested in perpetuating hierarchies—lab members are valued as co-constructors of knowledge and part of a supportive research community.

## Current projects

We are thrilled to be starting off at the University of Utah and have many current opportunities for students interested in epidemiology, evolution, computation, and health justice. Please reach out to discuss your interests—we’re looking forward to meeting you and learning with you!

-	Documenting the hidden risk of tuberculosis within US prisons and jails (epidemiology)
-	Identifying hotspots of tuberculosis transmission in Paraguay (spatial epidemiology) 
-	Measuring the impact of climate change on risk of pathogenic Nontuberculous mycobacteria (metagenomics, climate modeling)
-	Investigating the pathogenic potential of Great Salt Lake Dust (metagenomics)

## Undergraduates

We look forward to welcoming undergraduates through several programs. 

- [Undergraduate Research Program (UROP)](https://our.utah.edu/research-scholarship-opportunities/urop/): Funding for academic year research
- Health Science [LEAP Scholars](https://leap.utah.edu/): Funding for academic year research
- [Genomics Summer Research for Minorities](https://prod.pediatrics.medicine.utah.edu/pediatrics/research/education/gsrm/program-info): Undergrad funding for summer research
- [Wilkes Undergrad Scholars](https://wilkescenter.utah.edu/funding-opportunities/wilkes-scholars/): Undergrad funding for climate-related projects for semesters and summer research

## Graduate students

We are excited to work with students from the [Biosciences PhD Program](https://bioscience.utah.edu/), which has a lab rotation program, and the [Population Health PhD Program](https://medicine.utah.edu/population-health-sciences/phd). We are also excited to work with students across the university, including the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medicine.utah.edu/dbmi).

## Postdoctoral & medical fellows

[Wilkes Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://wilkescenter.utah.edu/funding-opportunities/wilkes-center-postdoctoral-program/) (due March 15, 2023): we are excited to work with applicants for this new climate science fellowship.


There are many additional sources of NSF, NIH, and foundation funding to support students and fellows.
